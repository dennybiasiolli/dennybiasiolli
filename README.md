# 👋 Hi there, I'm Denny

I'm a developer and a trail runner, and I enjoy both coding and hitting the trails.
When I'm not busy turning lines of code into beautiful and functional applications,
you can find me running through the mountains and breathing in the fresh air.
I'm a firm believer that a healthy mind and body lead to better coding,
so I try to balance my love for technology with a love for the great outdoors.<br>
Just remember: if you can't find me at my desk, I'm probably out for a run!
